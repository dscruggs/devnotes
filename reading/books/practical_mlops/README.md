## [Chapter 1: Introduction to MLOps](./01_intro_mlops.md)

Discusses the importance of using DevOps principles in the context of ML

The solution to the added complexity of ML systems is to embrace automation

Topics include:

- What is MLOps?
- Devops principles and best practices
- Python CICD scaffold for projects
  - My implementation: <https://github.com/dscruggs/devopsscaffold>
- MLOps components and best practices

## [Chapter 2: MLOps Foundations](./02_mlops_foundations.md)

Gives foundational knowledge to be able to deploy ML into production

Topics Include:

- Cloud computing and Linux terminal
- DevOps/CICD
- Math and ML fundamentals
- Good examples of cloud deployments for ML using cloud shell and CICD pipelines

## [Chapter 3: MLOps for Containers and Edge Devices](./03_mlops_for_containers.md)

Gives GREAT overview on docker containers and some good examples of container workflows for ML

Topics Inlcude:

- Containers overview
  - dockerfiles, images, containers, image / dockerfile hubs
- Container best practices
  - linting and vulnerability scans
- Serving a container over HTTP (flask) example
- Some edge device stuff

## [Chapter 4: Continuous Delivery for Machine Learning Models](./04_continuous_delivery_for_ml.md)

You should strive for shipping models with very high confidence and in a resilient set of steps. This is what this chapter is about

Topics include:

- Packaging models and code in containers in an automated fashion (CI/CD)
  - great example for Github Actions
- pipelines
- Model deployment methodologies
- Deployed model tests

## [Chapter 5: AutoML and KaizenML](./05_automl_kaizenml.md)

AutoML is essential for MLOps because it automates the model building process and gives the best results. KaizenML is the process of improving and automating every other part of the pipeline

AutoML will not replace data scientists, but allow them to focus on the execution and high-level aspects of ML projects

Don't resist change for your ego, you don't need to build it to use it

Topics Include:

- AutoML
- KaizenML
- AutoML on various cloud platforms
- Open source AutoML
- Model explainability frameworks

## [Chapter 6: Monitoring and Logging](./06_monitoring_logging.md)

## Chapter 7: MLOps for AWS

## Chapter 8: MLOps for Azure

## Chapter 9: MLOps for GCP

## Chapter 10: Machine Learning Interoperability

## Chapter 11: Building MLOps Command Line Tools and Microservices

## Chapter 12: Machine Learning Engineering and MLOps Case Studies
