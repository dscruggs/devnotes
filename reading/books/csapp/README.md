# Computer Systems: A Programmer's Perspective

by Randal E. Bryant and David R. Oâ€™Hallaron

Lots of great info on the website <https://csapp.cs.cmu.edu/>

### [Chapter 1: A tour of computer systems](./01_tour_of_comp_sys.md)

Goes over the basics of computer systems and how they work.

Major takeaways:

- Hardware and software are complementary to making systems work
- Abstractions are important to simplify using the systems
- I/O is the bottleneck for most systems, not CPU ops
- Storage devices have hierarchies because larger storage is slower and more expensive
- OS serves as intermediary between software and hardware
- Networking is just another I/O device for computers to communicate with each other
