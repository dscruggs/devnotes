# Chapter 2: Your Data Science Could Use Some Engineering

ML Engineering can be thought of as a trinity of core concepts:

- Technology (tools, frameworks, algorithms)
- People (collaborative work, communication)
- Process (software dev standards, experimentation rigor, agile methods)

Projects that focus on each of these elements are usually successful, and ones that forget one or multiple of these elements generally fail

## Augmenting a complex profession with processes to increase project success

There's tons of technical details to think about in data science. ML engineering helps practitioners work in a more constructive way to focus on what truly matters: providing solutions to problems that actually work

## A foundation of simplicity

As exciting as new tech and approaches are, the effectiveness of a DS team is measured in the quality, stability, and cost of a solution it provides

**The most important principle of ML engineering is to pursue the simplest possible implementation to solve a problem**

A quick guide to building simplest solutions to ML problems, in ascending order of complexity:

1. Quick wins
    - data visualization
    - Aggregation / simple equations
    - changes in how people interact with a system / data inputs
2. Advanced Analytics
    - Simple heuristics
    - rule-based approaches
    - Descriptive analytics
3. Traditional ML
    - Predictive modeling (regression, classification, clustering)
    - Prescriptive modeling (recommendation engines, simulations)
4. Complex AI
    - Deep learning
    - Graph-based models
    - Instance-based models

Try to solve a problem with the simplest possible solution before trying more complex ones

## Co-opting Agile for ML

Most agile principles can be applied to ML software development, with increased focus on data, solving the problem, and collaboration with SMEs

Selected principles:

- assume nothing about your data, always validate and analyze
- focus on solving a problem in the simplest way possible
- ML projects are built around quantitative and qualitative evaluations as a measure of effectiveness
- iterative and sustainable development with periodic demonstrations of functionality
- the best ML solutions come from teams that focus on solving a problem above all else
- frequently collaborate with SMEs
- embrace and expect change

### Communication and Cooperation

Core tenets of ML development are focused on people

1. Collaborative involvement between ML team and the business is key
2. Communication within the ML team is critical

- lone wolf mentality leads to a lot of rework or frustration from the business unit
- frequent demos to business users as well as internal code reviews and demonstrations on how changes will affect data is very important

### Embracing and expecting change

Change will almost always happen in ML projects. Build a project architecture that supports rapid iteration and modifications

## Foundation of ML Engineering

Devops is the foundation. Lots of similarities with extra complexity for ML. Great chart in the book on this
