Nice words of advice given by Ben:  
*Ask the experienced rather than the learned.*
—Arab proverb  
*It is best to learn wisdom by the experience of others.*
—Latin proverb

This book is split into 3 parts with chapters within each. I want to keep the chapters as the main visual sections, so I'm just going to bold the sections.

**Part 1: An Introduction to Machine Learning Engineering**  

## [Chapter 1: An Introduction to Machine Learning Engineering](./01_what_is_mle.md)

Discusses what ML engineering is and the core tenets and goals of it

ML engineers need to know aspects of data science, software engineering, project management, and many other things to be sucessful, all with the goal of ensuring ML projects succeed in being deployed and providing measurable business value

Focus on solving the problem, less on technical details until you understand the problem to be solved completely

Six project phases: planning, scoping and research, experimentation, development, deployment, evaluation (maintenance and proving value)

Topics include:

- tenets of ML Engineering
- High level roadmap for ML projects

## [Chapter 2: Your Data Science Could Use Some Engineering](./02_data_science_eng.md)

Covers differences between data scientist and ML engineer, and gives strategies from software engineering to run successful ML projects

ML Engineering can be thought of as a trinity of core concepts:

- Technology (tools, frameworks, algorithms)
- People (collaborative work, communication)
- Process (software dev standards, experimentation rigor, agile methods)

ML Engineering is all about keeping things as simple as possible to solve a given problem

Topics include:

- What is ML engineering
- Agile for ML
- Devops vs MLOps

## [Chapter 3: Planning and Scoping a Project](./03_planning_project.md)

Discusses planning and efficient solution evaluation methods for ML projects

The most important points here are to have clear communication with the business, especially in the early phases. Focus on the *what* and *why* during planning, and timebox your research and experiments to arrive at a working, practical solution as quickly as possible.

Topics include:

- How to plan out a project
- How to approach research
- How to approach experimentation and work estimation

## [Chapter 4: Communication and Logistics of Projects](./04_comms_logistics.md)

Goes over the structure of meetings and communication involved with projects. Major points are around clear and open communication is key, constant feedback is key, and you should tie meetings to milestones and with a clear agenda to not waste peoples time

Topics include:

- questions to ask the business during planning
- meeting structure and goals during a project
- approaching experimentation communication
- dealing with business rules and project changes
- explaining ML topics to laymen

## [Chapter 5: Experimentation in Action](./05_experimentation.md)
