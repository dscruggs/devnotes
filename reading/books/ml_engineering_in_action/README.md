Nice words of advice given by Ben:  
*Ask the experienced rather than the learned.*
—Arab proverb  
*It is best to learn wisdom by the experience of others.*
—Latin proverb

This book is split into 3 parts with chapters within each. I want to keep the chapters as the main visual sections, so I'm just going to bold the sections.

**Part 1: An Introduction to Machine Learning Engineering**  

## [Chapter 1: An Introduction to Machine Learning Engineering](./01_what_is_mle.md)

Discusses what ML engineering is and the core tenets and goals of it

ML engineers need to know aspects of data science, software engineering, project management, and many other things to be sucessful, all with the goal of ensuring ML projects succeed in being deployed and providing measurable business value

Focus on solving the problem, less on technical details until you understand the problem to be solved completely

Six project phases: planning, scoping and research, experimentation, development, deployment, evaluation (maintenance and proving value)

Topics include:

- tenets of ML Engineering
- High level roadmap for ML projects

## [Chapter 2: Your Data Science Could Use Some Engineering](./02_data_science_eng.md)

Covers differences between data scientist and ML engineer, and gives strategies from software engineering to run successful ML projects

Topics include:
