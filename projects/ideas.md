# Project Ideas

Notes on potential project idea

## Full Stack

This will include a front end and some UI interaction w/ the model outputs

- Posture detection w/ webcam
  - try to make your own model, lots of prebuilt models for binary classification
- Chatbot w/ LLM
  - use prebuilt models (openAI an obvious choice, maybe LLAMA 2 / mixtral for open source)
- Language translation
  - use prebuilt models (azures is nice)
- Stock price prediction
  - yahoo / other dataset
  - build own forecasting model. Maybe have multiple forecasts w/ different models for comparison?
  - have nice visualizations w/ interactivity
  - allow for choosing which stock you'd like to see as well as overall market trends
  - list of biggest predicted movers
- recommendation system for movies / shows
  - netflix dataset, movielens dataset
  - lots of out of the box recommendation systems. Lots of room for model experimentation here

## Modeling

- Car quality detection
  - dataset TBD
- Recommendation system for ecommerce
  - kaggle, amazon datasets
- Fraud detection
  - Kaggle datasets
